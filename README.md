# 👥 NotifyU - Private Group Communication & Management System

**NotifyU** is a secure and private group management app that allows a **group leader** to organize, update, and notify members with full control. Whether you're managing a **private team**, a **public organization**, a **club**, or any type of group, NotifyU gives leaders the ability to maintain order, send updates, and ensure that only the right people see the right messages — all without distractions or outside interference.

---

## 🔐 Purpose

NotifyU is **not** a typical chat or notification app. It is a **leader-focused broadcasting and control system**. Members receive updates, but **only the leader** can create, edit, and control the group’s communication and structure.

Perfect for:
- Team or project management
- Club or community coordination
- Educational or academic notices
- Religious, cultural, or social groups
- Event planning and private update delivery

## 🎯 Key Features

- 👤 **Leader-Centric Control**  
  Only the group leader (or selected admins) can send updates and manage the group.

- 🔒 **Full Privacy**  
  Data is kept private and only visible to group members. No public visibility.

- 🔔 **One-Way Notification System**  
  Members receive updates silently — no replies, chats, or group clutter.

- 📝 **Real-Time Announcements**  
  Instantly send text, image, or audio-based messages to all members.

- 📋 **Public or Private Groups**  
  Allow users to join by invite or restrict completely.

  Add or remove members, manage group settings, and maintain clean structure.
